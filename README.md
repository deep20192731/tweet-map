# tweet-map
Heap Map of Tweets
1) Used Java Scripe for authentication with Twitter Streaming Api's and fetching tweets.
2) Used AWS Elastic Search Service to store tweets. Used JEST Client for that, since AWS ES only exposes a REST endpoint for it.
3) Created a simple angular app and used Google Maps JS api's to show the tweets on the map (angular app may be naive :))
