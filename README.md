# tweet-map
Heap Map of Tweets <br/>
1) Used Java Scribe for authentication with Twitter Streaming Api's and fetching tweets. <br/>
2) Used AWS Elastic Search Service to store tweets. Used JEST Client for that, since AWS ES only exposes a REST endpoint for it. <br/>
3) Created a simple angular app and used Google Maps JS api's to show the tweets on the map (angular app may be naive :)) <br/>
